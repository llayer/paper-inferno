  Complex computer simulations are commonly required for accurate
  data modelling in many scientific disciplines, including experimental
  High Energy Physics, making statistical
  inference challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood
  evaluation for the observed data.
  Furthermore, sometimes one is interested on inference drawn over
  a subset of the generative model parameters while taking into account model
  uncertainty or misspecification on the remaining nuisance parameters.
  In this work, we show how non-linear
  summary statistics can be constructed by minimising
  inference-motivated losses via stochastic gradient descent such that they
  provide the smallest uncertainty for the parameters of interest. As a
  use case, the problem of confidence interval estimation for
  the mixture coefficient in a multi-dimensional two-component mixture
  model (i.e. signal vs background) is considered, where the proposed technique
  outperforms summary statistics based on probabilistic
  classification,
  a commonly used alternative which does not account for the presence
  of nuisance
  parameters in the optimisation.

# Introduction

Simulator-based inference is currently at the core of many scientific
fields, such as population genetics, epidemiology, and experimental
particle physics.
In these situations the generative procedure implicitly defined
in the simulation often lacks a tractable probability density
$p(\boldsymbol{x}| \boldsymbol{\theta})$, where
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$
is the vector of model parameters. Given some experimental
observations $D = \{\boldsymbol{x}_0,...,\boldsymbol{x}_n\}$,
a problem of special relevance for these
disciplines is statistical inference on a subset of model parameters
$\boldsymbol{\omega}$.
This can be approached via likelihood-free inference
algorithms such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) [@beaumont2002approximate],
simplified synthetic likelihoods [@wood2010statistical]
or density estimation-by-comparison approaches
[@cranmer2015approximating].

Because the relation between the parameters of the model and the data is
only available via forward simulation, most likelihood-free inference algorithms
tend to be computationally expensive due to the need of repeated simulations
to cover the parameter space. When data are
high-dimensional, likelihood-free
inference can rapidly become inefficient, so low-dimensional summary statistics
$\boldsymbol{t}(D)$ are used instead of the raw data
for tractability. The choice of summary statistic for such cases becomes
critical,
given that naive choices might cause loss of
relevant information and a corresponding degradation of the power
of resulting statistical inference.

In many cases, such as particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
the nature of the generative model (i.e. a mixture of different
processes)
allows the treatment of the problem as
signal (s) vs background (b) classification [@adam2015higgs],
when the task becomes one of effectively estimating
an approximation of $t_B(\boldsymbol{x}) = p_{s}(\boldsymbol{x})/(p_{s}(\boldsymbol{x})+
p_{b}(\boldsymbol{x}))$ by means of probabilistic classification.
While the use of classifiers to learn a summary statistic can
increase the discovery sensitivity, the simulations used to generate
the samples which are needed to train the classifier often depend on additional
uncertain parameters (commonly referred as nuisance parameters).
These nuisance parameters are not of immediate interest but
have to be accounted for in order to make quantitative statements about the
model parameters based on the available data.
Classification-based summary statistics
cannot easily account for those effects, so their inference power is degraded
when nuisance parameters are finally taken into account.

In this work, a new machine learning method referred to as
Inference-Aware Neural Optimisation (INFERNO) [@de2018inferno] is presented,
that
constructs non-linear summary statistics directly
optimising the expected amount of information about the subset of
parameters of interest, by explicitly
and taking into account
the effect of nuisance parameters.
The optimisation procedure is carried out iteratively by stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) [@Goodfellow-et-al-2016] using small subsets
of available simulated data.
The learned
summary statistics can be used to
perform robust and efficient classical or
Bayesian inference from the observed data, so they can be readily applied
in place of current classification-based or domain-motivated summaries
in current scientific data analyses.

# Method {#sec:method}

In this section, a machine learning technique to learn non-linear
sample summary statistics is described.
The method seeks to minimise the expected variance
of the parameters of interest obtained via a non-parametric
simulation-based synthetic likelihood. A graphical description of the
technique  is depicted on [@Fig:diagram].
The parameters of a neural network are
optimised by SGD within an automatic differentiation
framework, where the considered loss function accounts for the details of
the statistical model as well as the expected effect of nuisance parameters.

![Learning inference-aware summary statistics (see text for
  details).](gfx/figure1.pdf){#fig:diagram width=80%}

The family of summary statistics $\boldsymbol{t}(D)$ considered in this
work is composed by a neural network model applied to each dataset
observation $\boldsymbol{h}(\boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\phi}) : \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}^{m}$,
whose parameters $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ will be learned during the
training phase.
The neural network $\boldsymbol{h}(\boldsymbol{x}_i; \boldsymbol{\phi})$
will reduce the dimensionality from the $d$-dimensional inputs to
the $m$-dimensional outputs and will effectively define the summary
statistic transformation.
The next step is to map observation outputs to a
dataset summary statistic, which will in turn be calibrated
and optimised via a non-parametric likelihood
$\mathcal{L}(D; \boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi})$
created using a set of $l$ simulated observations $G_\textrm{MC}=
\{\boldsymbol{x}_0,...,\boldsymbol{x}_{l}\}$, generated at
a certain instantiation of the simulator parameters
$\boldsymbol{\theta}_\textrm{MC}$.

In experimental high-energy physics, histograms of
observation counts are the most
commonly used non-parametric density estimator because the
resulting likelihoods
can be expressed as the product of Poisson factors. A naive
sample summary statistic can be built from the output of the neural network
by simply assigning each observation $\boldsymbol{x}$ to a bin corresponding
to the cardinality of the maximum element of
$\boldsymbol{h}(\boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\phi})$,
which can in turn be used to build the following likelihood, where the
expectation for each bin is taken from the simulated sample $G_\textrm{MC}$:
$$
\mathcal{L}(D; \boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi})=\prod_{i=0 }^m
             \textrm{Pois} \left ( t_i (D; \boldsymbol{\phi}) \:  |
             \: \left ( \frac{n}{l} \right ) t_i (G_\textrm{MC};\boldsymbol{\phi}) \right )
$$ {#eq:likelihood}
where $t_i (D; \boldsymbol{\phi})$ are the sum of observation
for which the maximum is at the bin $j$ and
the $n/l$ factor accounts for the different number of
observations in the simulated samples.
In the above construction, the chosen
family of summary statistics is non-differentiable due to
the $argmax$ operator, so gradient-based updates for the parameters
cannot be computed. To work around this problem, a differentiable
approximation $\hat{\boldsymbol{t}}(D ; \boldsymbol{\phi})$ is considered.
This function is defined by means of a *softmax* operator
$\hat{t}_i(D;\boldsymbol{\phi})=\sum_{x \in D} e^{f_i(\boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\phi})/\tau}  \ \sum_{j=0}^{m} e^{f_j(\boldsymbol{x}; \boldsymbol{\phi})/\tau}$,
where the temperature hyper-parameter
$\tau$ will regulate the softness of the operator.
Similarly, let us
denote by $\hat{\mathcal{L}}(D; \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\phi})$
the differentiable approximation of the non-parametric likelihood
obtained by substituting $\boldsymbol{t}(D ; \boldsymbol{\phi})$ with
$\hat{\boldsymbol{t}}(D ; \boldsymbol{\phi})$. Instead
of using the observed data $D$, the value of $\hat{\mathcal{L}}$
may be computed
when the observation for each bin is equal to its corresponding
expectation based on
the simulated sample $G_\textrm{MC}$, which is commonly denoted as the
Asimov likelihood [@cowan2011asymptotic] $\hat{\mathcal{L}}_A$.
By taking the negative logarithm and expanding in
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$ around $\boldsymbol{\theta}_\textrm{MC}$, we can obtain
the Fisher information matrix [@fisher_1925] for the
Asimov likelihood:
$$
{I(\boldsymbol{\theta})}_{ij}
= \mathop{\mathbb{E}} \left [
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial {\theta_i} \partial {\theta_j}}
 \left ( - \log \mathcal{\hat{L}}_A(\boldsymbol{\theta};
 \boldsymbol{\phi}) \right ) \right ]
$$ {#eq:fisher_info}
which can be computed via automatic differentiation
if the simulation function $g(\boldsymbol{\theta}_\textrm{MC})$
or an approximation
of the effect
of varying $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ over the simulated
dataset $G_\textrm{MC}$ are
differentiable.

The inverse of the Fisher information can be used as an
approximate estimator of the expected covariance matrix of the
parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ for an unbiased estimator.
In Bayesian
terminology, this approach is referred to as the Laplace approximation
[@laplace1986memoir].
The loss function used for stochastic optimisation of the neural network
parameters $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ can be any function of the inverse
of the Fisher information matrix at $\boldsymbol{\theta}_\textrm{MC}$, depending on the
ultimate inference aim. The diagonal
elements $I_{ii}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_\textrm{MC})$ correspond to the expected
variance of each of the $\phi_i$ under the approximation mentioned
before, so if the aim is efficient inference about one of the parameters
$\omega_0 = \theta_k$ a candidate loss function is $U = I_{kk}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_\textrm{MC})$
which corresponds to the expected width of the confidence interval
for $\omega_0$ accounting also for the effect of the other nuisance
parameters in $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.

# Experiments {#sec:d-synthetic-mixture}

In this section, we first study the effectiveness of the inference-aware
optimisation in a synthetic mixture problem where the likelihood is known. We then
compare our results with those obtained by standard classification-based
summary statistics. The code for reproducing the results
is available online [@code_repository], using \textsc{TensorFlow}
[@tensorflow2015-whitepaper]
and \textsc{TensorFlow Probability} [@tran2016edward;@dillon2017tensorflow].

To demonstrate the usage of the proposed approach, a three-dimensional
mixture example with two components
$p(\boldsymbol{x}| \mu, r, \lambda) = (1-\mu) f_b(\boldsymbol{x} | r, \lambda) 
+ \mu f_s(\boldsymbol{x})$
is considered.
One component will be referred as background $f_b(\boldsymbol{x} | r, \lambda)$ and
the other as signal $f_s(\boldsymbol{x})$; their probability density functions
are taken to correspond respectively to:
$$
\scriptstyle f_b(\boldsymbol{x} | r, \lambda) =
\mathcal{N} \left (
  (x_0, x_1) \, \middle | \,
  (2+r, 0),
  \begin{bmatrix}
    5 & 0 \\
    0 & 9 \\
   \end{bmatrix}
\right)
Exp (x_2 | \lambda)
\quad
f_s(\boldsymbol{x}) =
\mathcal{N} \left (
  (x_0, x_1) \, \middle | \,
  (1,1),
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 \\
   \end{bmatrix}
\right)
Exp (x_2 | 2)
$$ {#eq:sig_bkg_den}
so that $(x_0,x_1)$ are distributed according to a multivariate normal
distribution while $x_2$ follows an independent exponential distribution
both for background and signal.

In this toy problem, we consider a case where the underlying model
predicts that the total number of observations are Poisson distributed with
a mean $s+b$, where $s$ and $b$ are the expected number of signal
and background observations. Thus the following parametrisation will be
more convenient for building sample-based likelihoods:
$$
p(\boldsymbol{x}| s, r, \lambda, b) = \frac{b}{ s+b}
 f_b(\boldsymbol{x} | r, \lambda) +
 \frac{s}{s+b} f_s(\boldsymbol{x}).
$$ {#eq:mixture_alt}
If the probability density is known, but the expectation for
the number of observed events depends on the model parameters, the likelihood
can be extended [@barlow1990extended] with a Poisson count term as:
$\mathcal{L}(s, r, \lambda, b) = \textrm{Pois}(n | s+b) \prod^{n} p(\boldsymbol{x}| s,r, \lambda, b)$
which will be used to provide an optimal inference baseline when benchmarking
the different approaches. Another quantity of relevance is the conditional
density ratio, which would correspond to the optimal classifier (in the
Bayes risk sense) separating
signal and background events in a balanced dataset (equal priors):
$$
t_B(\boldsymbol{x} | r, \lambda) =
\frac{f_s(\boldsymbol{x})}{
f_s(\boldsymbol{x}) + f_b(\boldsymbol{x} | r, \lambda) }.
$$ {#eq:opt_clf}

While the synthetic nature of this example allows one to rapidly generate
training data
on demand,
a training dataset of 200,000 simulated observations has been considered,
in order
to study how the proposed method performs when training data is limited.
Half of the simulated
observations correspond to the signal component and half to the background
component. The latter has been generated using $r=0.0$ and
$\lambda=3.0$.
A validation holdout from the training dataset of 200,000
observations is only used for computing relevant metrics during
training and
to control over-fitting. The final figures of merit that allow to
compare different approaches are computed
using a larger dataset of 1,000,000 observations.

The statistical model described above has up to four unknown parameters: the
expected number of signal observations $s$,
the background mean shift $r$,
the background exponential rate in the third dimension $\lambda$, and
the expected number of background observations. The effect of the
expected number of signal and background observations $s$ and $b$
can be easily included in the computation graph by 
weighting the signal and background observations.
Instead the effect of $r$ and $\lambda$, both nuisance parameters
that will define the background distribution, is more easily modelled
as a transformation of the input data $\boldsymbol{x}$. In particular,
$r$ is a nuisance parameter that causes a shift on the background
along the first dimension  adn
the effect of $\lambda$ can be modelled by multiplying
$x_2$ by the ratio between the $\lambda_0$ used for generation and the
one being modelled.

For this problem, we are interested in carrying out statistical
inference on the parameter of interest $s$. 
The performance of inference-aware optimisation
will be compared with classification-based summary statistics for
a series of inference benchmarks based on the synthetic problem described above
that vary in the number of nuisance parameters considered and their constraints,
as shown in \autoref{tab:benchmark_table}. For Benchmark 0 no nuisance
parameters are considered, so the classification approach is expected
to provide near optimal summary statistics. The rest of the benchmarks
correspond to the presence of nuisance parameters,
differing among them in their number and constrains. The main figure of merit
will be the expected
uncertainty in the parameter of interest $s$ for the inference problem
defined for each benchmark and conditioned
on the true value of the parameters of $s=50$, $r=0.0$,
$\lambda=3.0$ and $b=1000$.

A supervised machine learning model can be trained to discriminate signal
and background, considering parameters $r$ and $\lambda$ fixed, as a way
to obtain a variable transformation that is informative about the
mixture fraction or $s$.
The output of such a model are class probabilities
$c_b$ and $c_s$ given an observation $\boldsymbol{x}$, the latter will
asymptotically tend to the optimal classifier from [@Eq:opt_clf] given
enough data and a flexible enough model.
The classification output is a powerful
learned feature that can be used as a summary statistic; but
its construction
ignores the effect of the nuisance parameters.

\end{table}

When using classification-based summary statistics, the construction of
a summary statistic does depend on the presence of nuisance parameters, so the same
model is trained independently of the benchmark considered.
For the approach
presented in this work, inference-aware neural optimisation, the effect of the
nuisance parameters and their constraints can be taken into account during training.
Hence, 5 different training procedures for \textsc{INFERNO} will be considered,
one for each of the benchmarks, denoted by the corresponding benchmark number. 

The same basic network architecture is used both for cross-entropy (CE)
$L_\textrm{CE}=\sum_i y_i \log \hat{y}_i$ and
inference-aware training: two hidden layers of 100 nodes followed by
rectified linear unit (ReLU) [@Goodfellow-et-al-2016]
activations.
The number of nodes on the output
layer is two when
classification proxies are used, while for inference-aware classification
the number of output nodes
corresponds to the dimensionality of the sample summary statistics. For
the experiments shown in this work using the INFERNO technique,
an output size of $m=10$ has been used.
The final layer is followed by a softmax activation function and
a temperature $\tau = 0.1$ for inference-aware learning to ensure
that the differentiable approximations are close to the true values.

:::


In [@Fig:training_dynamics], the training dynamics of inference-aware optimisation
are shown by the validation loss, which corresponds
to the approximate expected variance
of parameter $s$, as a function of the step for 10 random-initialised
instances of the \textsc{INFERNO} model corresponding to Benchmark 2.
All inference-aware models were trained during 200 epochs with SGD using
mini-batches of 2000 observations
and a learning rate $\gamma=10^{-6}$. All the model initialisations
converge to summary statistics that provide low variance for the estimator of
$s$.

To compare with alternative approaches,
the profiled likelihood [@tanabashi2018review] obtained both with
the INFERNO-based and
classifier-based
summary statistics, accounting for the
effect of nuisance parameters defined in Benchmark 2, are shown
in [@Fig:profile_likelihood].
The expected uncertainty of the trained models are
used for subsequent inference on the value of $s$
can be estimated from the profile width when $\Delta \mathcal{L} = 0.5$.
The average width for the profile likelihood with inference-aware,
$16.97\pm0.11$, can be
compared with the one obtained by uniformly binning the output of
classification-based models in 10 bins, $24.01\pm0.36$.
The models based on
CE loss were
trained during 200 epochs using a mini-batch size of 64 and a fixed learning
rate of $\gamma=0.001$.

A more complete study of the improvement provided by the INFERNO
training procedure is provided in \autoref{tab:results_table},
where the median and 1-sigma
percentiles on the expected absolute uncertainty on $s$ are provided for 100
random-initialised instances of each model. In addition, results for 100
random-initialised CE neural network models trained as previously
indicated, the optimal (Bayes) classifier
$t_B(\boldsymbol{x} | r = 0.0 , \lambda = 3.0)$
from [@Eq:opt_clf],
and the analytical likelihood-based inference are also
included.
The uncertainties shown in
\autoref{tab:results_table},
with the exception of the analytical likelihood which was based on the
extended analytical likelihood,
were obtained with a binned likelihood by interpolating
the histograms when the nuisance parameters
are varied.

    and the analytical likelihood.}

Except for Benchmark 0, the confidence intervals obtained using
INFERNO-based
summary statistics are narrower than those using
classification and tend to be much closer to those expected when using
the true model likelihood for inference. Unsurprinsingly,
the results for Benchmark 0,
when no nuisance parameters are considered and thus the mixture components
are perfectly known, show that classification-based summaries in this simplified
setting can outperform the INFERNO technique.

The analytical likelihood, which amounts to use the true generative likelihood
for inference, can be thought of an upper bound for the likelihood-free
setting
because it most effectively uses all the information of the data to constrain
all the model parameters. The relative improvement over classification
increases when more nuisance parameters are considered.
As shown in \autoref{tab:results_table}, the constraining power of the summary
statistic generated by INFERNO is stronger when it is constructed to solve
the corresponding inference question, i.e. the training based on
other benchmarks is sub-optimal. Thus the results also
seem to suggest the inclusion of the detailed information about the inference
problem in the INFERNO technique leads to comparable or better results than
its omission.

# Conclusions

In this work we have described a new approach for building
non-linear summary statistics for
likelihood-free inference that directly minimises the expected
variance of the parameters of interest, which is considerably more
effective than the use of classification surrogates when nuisance
parameters are present. The application of INFERNO to non-synthetic examples,
such as the systematic-extended
Higgs dataset [@estrade2017adversarial], are left for future studies.
